# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves integrating Replicate API to replace the current mock video generation provider in the Peppo Video App. The goal is to enable actual text-to-video generation using Replicate's cheapest text-to-video model while maintaining all existing functionality and making minimal code changes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate Replicate API for video generation, so that the application can generate real videos instead of using mock responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is configured with a valid Replicate API key THEN it SHALL use Replicate's text-to-video model for video generation
2. WHEN a user submits a text prompt THEN the system SHALL send the request to Replicate API and return a job ID
3. WHEN the system polls for job status THEN it SHALL check Replicate's prediction status and update accordingly
4. WHEN video generation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide access to the generated video file
5. WHEN a video is generated by Replicate THEN it SHALL be visible and playable in the web frontend interface just like the placeholder.mp4 currently is

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain backward compatibility, so that existing features continue to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Replicate provider is integrated THEN all existing API endpoints SHALL continue to function identically
2. WHEN the provider is switched to Replicate THEN the job caching mechanism SHALL continue to work
3. WHEN video generation fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully with appropriate error messages
4. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL automatically select the Replicate provider based on environment configuration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want minimal code changes, so that the integration is clean and doesn't disrupt existing architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing Replicate integration THEN only the provider layer SHALL be modified
2. WHEN adding Replicate dependency THEN it SHALL be added to requirements.txt
3. WHEN configuring the provider THEN only environment variables SHALL need to be updated
4. WHEN the integration is complete THEN no changes SHALL be required to the main application logic, services, or API endpoints
